# CS495-Maze-Project
Term Project for CS495 - Artificial Intelligence

What is this project?
This program contains a player that traverses a maze and finds the goal through trial and error.
The player keeps track of the final direction it moved in at each intersection and saves it in memory. 
When it runs through the maze the second time, it knows what to do at each intersection. It does this 
by mapping the coordinates of each intersection to the last direction it moved in and following accordingly.

What's included:
- The Unity project files
- The compiled version of the program (Maze Project.exe)

How to run the program:
Just open the "Maze Project.exe" file to run it.
If you encounter any errors, try restarting the program and clearing the data.
